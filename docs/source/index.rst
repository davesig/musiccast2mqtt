==========================================

**musiccast2mqtt** is an interface between Yamaha MusicCast devices and MQTT.
It is based on the `mqttgateway <http://mqttgateway.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ library.
It translates incoming MQTT messages into MusicCast commands.
The MQTT syntax required is flexible and configurable.
